            <div class='intro_section__bio'>
                <p>My name is <b>Jung-Cheng (Albert) Ho</b>. I have 1.5 year of professional software engineering experience, 
                    including experiences in web programming and machine learning.
                </p>
                <p>In April 2020, I joined Micro-System Research Lab at Nation Taiwan University as a <b>Full-time Research Assistant</b>. 
                    During my time as a research assistant, I was working writing a C program that enabled our lab's 
                    machine learning accelerating chip to complete the training process. Since the chip can only accelerate 
                    convolution computations, when it comes to other computations like pooling layer and activation functions, 
                    it will need the help from software program. Also, there exist size limitations for convolution computation. 
                    Therefore, my program will also help to partition the images into smaller ones. I implemented data reuse method 
                    and fused operations to <b>reduce the time consumptions by 100 times</b>. The software + accelerator method achieved 
                    the same accuracy (>99%) as that trained by GPU.
                 </p>
                <p>Starting from Feburary 2021, I joined <b>Houzz Inc.</b> as a <b>Full-time Full-stack Software Engineer</b>. 
                    I worked remotely with the team located in Palo Alto, California. At Houzz, I was familiar with 
                    <b>Frontend Development</b>, including <b>React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</b>. 
                    I implemented several changes on home page, including photo carousel, feature lists, and the modification of system 
                    message destination. The result of A/B tests shows that the sign-up rate increased significantly. 
                    I also worked on a project to migrate and refactor the pricing data retrieval from hard-coded configurations into 
                    backend support with <b>GraphQL</b> query. In this project I have the chance to deal with <b>PHP</b> backend 
                    and the design of the systems.  
                </p>
                <p>I love playing soccer during my free time. I joined the departmental soccer team during all four years of my 
                    college time. Also, I served as the <b>Team Captain</b> in my junior year. During that year, I worked on recruiting 
                    new members, and also held team activities to let our team member closer to each other. The chemistry of the team 
                    was so great and we finally won two championship, including National EE soccer cup champion.
                </p>
                <p>I am currently studying in ECE master at <b>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</b>, and planning to graduate by December 2022. 
                    I am now looking for <b>2022 summer SDE intern</b> opportunities.
